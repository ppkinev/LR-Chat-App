# Video Stream App with Payed messages
Kinda custom made copy of Youtube stream with chat service.
You watch a stream and can talk to the streamer, if you want your messages to be pinned you pay with internal currency.
More you pay, the longer the messages stays pinned and visible.

* ES6
* React, Redux, Sagas
* Styled Components (CSS-in-JS)
* Webpack
* WebSockets
* OpenID
* Atomic design
* Storybook

There were no design or guide except the idea and couple of screenshots of google service, so all UI/UX and other interactions were done by myself.

```
Unfortunately, the company it was built for got bankrupt lsat November, 
so they closed all possible services, including PROD and TEST APIs.

So the APP can't be launched right now, until a new API provided or
some dummy data added.
